# Machine-Learning-Classification-Models-
Utilizing TensorFlow, model_5 excels in classifying Fashion MNIST items. Its Sequential Neural Network architecture, with ReLU activation and softmax output, achieves precise predictions. Trained over 20 epochs with Adam optimizer, it offers Great accuracy, validated by a visually striking confusion matrix.

# This repository contains code for a machine learning classification model developed for the Fashion MNIST dataset. Below are the main components of the code:

# Finding the Ideal Learning Rate:
A function to find the ideal learning rate is implemented, plotting the learning rates against the loss.

# Confusion Matrix Function:
This function generates a confusion matrix for model evaluation, allowing visualization of classification performance.

# Plotting Random Images:
A function to randomly select and plot images from the dataset, displaying both predicted and true labels.

# Model Architecture Visualization:
The architecture of the best model (model_5) is visualized using plot_model from TensorFlow Keras utils.

# Best Model Training:
The best model (model_5) is defined as a Sequential Neural Network with specific layers and activations.
It is compiled with appropriate loss, optimizer, and metrics.
Training is conducted over 20 epochs using normalized training data, with validation data for evaluation.

# Usage:
Run each code segment sequentially to utilize the functionalities provided.
Ensure necessary dependencies, including TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib, are installed.

# Note:
This code serves as a demonstration of building and training a neural network model for fashion item classification.
Additional customization and optimization may be required based on specific use cases and datasets.
